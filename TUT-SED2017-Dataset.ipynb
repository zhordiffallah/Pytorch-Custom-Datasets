This preparation is crucial for subsequent stages such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. With the dataset correctly set up and verified, we can now proceed to further analysis and experimentation to advance our research or project objectives. Feel free to build on this setup with additional analysis, feature extraction, or model training as needed."
