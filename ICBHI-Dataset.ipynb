This method allows us to efficiently gather all audio data for the patients in one step. These audio files will later be linked to the patient data based on the patient number.\n","\n","3. **Loading Patient Demographic Data:**\n","   - Next, we load the patient demographic data from a `.txt` file using the `pandas` library. This data includes critical patient information such as age, sex, BMI, and, for children, weight and height. Since the file doesn’t have headers, we manually add them to make the data easier to work with and more interpretable.\n","\n","4. **Loading Diagnosis Data:**\n","   - Finally, we load the diagnosis data from a CSV file. This data contains the diagnosis for each patient, which is crucial for our analysis and machine learning tasks.

This step simplifies the process of linking the audio files with patient data.\n","\n","3. **Extracting the Patient Number:**\n","   - The patient number, crucial for merging data, is embedded within the audio file names.
